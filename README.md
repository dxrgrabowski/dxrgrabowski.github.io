This repository contains the source code for my personal technology blog. The site is built using the Hexo framework, which provides a fast and flexible infrastructure for generating static websites.

## Features
- Hexo Framework: The blog is based on Hexo, a powerful static site generator that uses templates and configurations to quickly build and deploy pages.
- Stylus for Styling: The site is styled using Stylus, a dynamic CSS preprocessor that allows for more flexible and maintainable stylesheets.
- JavaScript and EJS Templates: JavaScript is used in conjunction with Embedded JavaScript (EJS) templates to dynamically generate content based on configuration files.
- Automated Page Generation: The site uses a combination of templates, configuration, and content markdown files to autogenerate pages, ensuring a seamless workflow for adding new content.
