## 📚 Academic Pursuits: A Journey into the Heart of Technology

When I decided to go on an Erasmus exchange, I chose Dresden, Germany, for its high academic standards and the opportunity to immerse myself in the German language and culture. Here are the core subjects that shaped my semester:

### 1. **Operating System Construction (OSC)**
   - **Lectures, Labs, and Exercises**: The subject combined theory and hands-on experience, guided by *Operating System Construction* by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.
   - **DIY Operating System**: We designed an OS from the ground up, tackling challenges like schedulers, threads, interrupts, and coroutines. 🛠️
   - **Memorable Takeaway**: The complexity of building a system on bare metal provided a deep understanding of OS fundamentals.

### 2. **Concurrent and Distributed Systems (CDS)**
   - **Course Material**: Based on *The Art of Multiprocessor Programming* by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit.
   - **Key Concepts**: Multiprocessor architectures, mutual exclusion, linearizability, atomic registers, consensus, and spin locks. 🔄
   - **Highlight**: Learning about the CMPXCHG instruction on x86 processors—a key element of modern multiprogramming.

### 3. **Automotive Software Engineering**
   - **Focus**: High-level management, methodologies, and technical elements like sensors, connection topology, and ECUs. 🚗
   - **FSD Trip**: Agile workshops and exploring AI in vehicle diagnostics and autonomous driving.
   - **Guest Lecture**: Insights from the Fraunhofer Institute on sensorics in autonomous vehicles.

## 🎉 Student Life: A Thriving International Community

Dresden’s vibrant student life was a pleasant surprise, fueled by the active Erasmus Student Network (ESN).

- **Cafe Lingua**: Every Monday, local bars hosted a multilingual meet-up where students could practice languages and meet people from around the world. 🗣️
- **Länder Party**: Themed parties every Tuesday celebrated different countries with music, food, and cultural traditions. 🌎
- **Kultur Buro Campus**: Organized fantastic activities and trips, like the unforgettable excursion to Saxon Switzerland, known for its stunning views. 🏞️

## 🏙️ Living in Dresden: Costs, Convenience, and Charm

- **Accommodation**: I lived in a 15-story dormitory on Wundtstrasse, just 2 km from campus, with the amazing SLUB library and two canteens nearby. 🏢
- **Cost of Living**: Surprisingly affordable, at around 1.3 to 1.6 times Polish prices, making it easier to manage expenses. 💶
- **Getting Around**: The city was well-connected by trams and bike-friendly, with numerous paths making commuting easy. 🚲
- **Green Spaces**: Dresden’s commitment to green belts and parks added to its charm, providing a refreshing escape from city life. 🌳

## 🤔 Reflecting on My Erasmus Experience

Choosing Dresden for my Erasmus semester was one of the best decisions I made. It allowed me to advance my technical skills, improved my German, and immerse myself in a new culture. The friendships, knowledge, and memories from this journey are invaluable.

This journey, and specifically the fascinating subject of OSC, indirectly prompted me to create a blog for it.

If you’re considering Erasmus, I encourage you to look beyond the typical sunny spots and explore options like Dresden, where academic challenges, a lively student scene, and the charm of a unique city await you. 🌟
