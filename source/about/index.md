Hi, I'm Dawid, a Linux C/C++ software engineer 👨‍💻 studying and working on my own projects since 2021 🚀
🔭 Engaged in projects involving UAV and Ground Control Systems, spanning both civilian and military industries.

🌱 Actively broadening expertise in C/C++, Rust and Linux systems.

I created this blog because I wanted to write down somewhere my knowledge that I felt was starting to fall out of my head due to lack of consolidation.

More about me and my career here: <a class="icon" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawidgraabowski/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin <%= icon_class_name %>" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
